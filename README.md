This repository contains in-class hands-on materials, problem sets, and term project resources for the Fall 2022 version of ECON 140 at the University of California, Berkeley, led by Ryan D. Edwards (ryanedw at berkeley.edu). There are also some Section materials prepared by graduate student instructors.

The course adhered closely to Mastering Metrics, by Joshua Angrist and Steve Pischke, covering chapters 1-5 and part of chapter 6 mostly in order.

Problem sets and in-class hands-on were guided activities written in R inside Jupyter notebooks, which can run easily on Berkeley's datahub.berkeley.edu
