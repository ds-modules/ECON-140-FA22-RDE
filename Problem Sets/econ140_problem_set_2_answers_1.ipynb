    "In this problem set, you will examine a dataset showing graduate admission decisions, a dichotomous measure of gender, and academic department from the fall 1973 application cohort. The dataset is described and analyzed by [P. J. Bickel, E. A. Hammel, J. W. O'Connell (1975) “Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley,” Science 187(4175): 398-404](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/1739581) and further described in [David Freedman, Robert Pisani, and Roger Purves (2007) Statistics 4th edition. New York: Norton, pp 17–20](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-4th-David-Freedman/dp/0393929728). I created this dataset using the description offered by FPP. There is a \"collapsed\" version of these data in __R__'s preloaded `datasets` package called `UCBAdmissions`."

Then within each of those columns, we see the split between people who identify as female (bottom) or male (top), so that gender identity is the $y$-variable. "

This likely reflects a variety of factors in these data from the 1970s, some of which may be present today as well. Women especially in the 1970s and earlier were typically dissuaded from continuing in scientific fields, either overtly or implicitly. There also is evidence from Harvard's Claudia Goldin and many others that even today, the pipeline for women into STEM, and into economics for example, is more closed than it is for men, for a variety of reasons. This story would result in women's graduate admissions being focused less on STEM departments and more on humanities and other fields. \n",

    "The other way one could approach this is by guessing that STEM fields are actually harder to get into. We suspect they are harder to major in, and that might be the reason to guess they are harder to get into. So one might guess the reverse story, that because women are less likely to have been STEM majors for example, then they might be more likely to be admitted into graduate school in those non-STEM fields. An additional perspective is useful: STEM fields have seen the most growth in demand in terms of jobs and training. Based on that, one might guess that STEM fields might have higher graduate admission rates."
