    "In this problem set we will examine the `injury` dataset within the Wooldridge repository, which includes measures of workers' compensation utilization and worker characteristics in Kentucky and Michigan around 1980. The data were collected by the [National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI)](https://www.ncci.com/pages/default.aspx) and analyzed by [Meyer, Viscusi, and Durbin (1995)](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/2118177).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenarios in Kentucky (KY) and Michigan (MI) were similar, although of course the two states differed in terms of industries, incomes, and other characteristics. Both states <i>raised the maximum weekly benefit</i> that workers could receive, by a large amount: from \\\\$131 to \\\\$217 or by 66% in KY, and from \\\\$181 to \\\\$307 or 70% in MI. Although high inflation rates during this period ate away some of the real value of these increases, they were comfortably high even after adjusting for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>What effect did this policy change have, if any, on benefit claiming behavior?</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Workers' compensation</b> plans differ in implementation across states, but the general structure replaces wages when a workplace injury prevents working. An injured worker's weekly workers' comp payment is a function of the worker's wage, via a \"replacement rate,\" above a floor and up to a ceiling. The floor grants low-paid workers a minimum weekly insurance payout, and the ceiling places a cap on the total amount paid. In between, workers are paid perhaps two-thirds or 66.67% of their weekly wages, the replacement rate for Kentucky cited in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Meyer, Viscusi, and Durbin discuss, the most common type of payment is for temporary total disabilities, where a person is unable to work but is expected to recover fully and return to work. As they describe on p. 324, \"temporary total claims have no fixed duration; their length is determined by the injured worker, his or her doctor, the employer, and its insurer.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Shown below, Figure 1 from [Meyer, Viscusi, and Durbin (1995)](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/2118177) illustrates this point and also the change associated with the increases in the maximum in Kentucky and Michigan in this time period."
